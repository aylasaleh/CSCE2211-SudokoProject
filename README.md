# CSCE2211-SudokoProject
About the project: a sudoku game. We are creating an advanced and intersting sudoku game utlizing c++ gui and libraries for implementation. As for the sudoku class itself, it does not generate sudokus randomly but rather has a library of sudokus from which it chooses from. As for the solution method, it is through backtracking.
